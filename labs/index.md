This page lists the lab activities.

In order to receive credit for completing a lab, you need to get a sign-off from your instructor.  There are four options for this:

1. For 110% of full credit: Get a sign-off in class on the day the lab is due.
2. For 100% of full credit: Submit the completed lab to Marmoset by the end of the day the lab is due.
3. For 90% of full credit: Get a sign-off in the class immediately following the one in which the lab is due.
4. For 50% of full credit: Submit the completed lab to Marmoset before the first exam to occur after the class in which the lab is due.

<div class="callout">
<b>Protip</b>: Work on the lab <i>before</i> coming to class.  This will allow you to ask good questions when we work on the lab in class, and will give you a much better chance of finishing the lab in class.
